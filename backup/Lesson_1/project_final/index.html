                        <p>
                            Currently, My hobbies center around programming (mainly in Python3) various things to gain a better understanding of programming concepts. 
                            I also enjoy reading (which I will discuss later) and biking around the city, which I have not been able to do as of late.

                        <p>
                            I own a cat named Rin. This cat is a ballastic piece of fur that has on more than one occasion rendered discomfort unto various family members.
                            She is my one true joy in this cold, uncaring universe.

                        <p>
                            I enjoy reading several genres, but most of my personal collection stems from books in the Sci-Fi/Dystopian genres. 
                            Some of my personal favorite books and series' are:
